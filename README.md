## About Symflower

This repository is for the community support of `symflower` and `symflower-server`, a code generation tool for Java that aims to reduce the routine efforts of unit and integration testing. 

Symflower brings three major new features to your favorite IDE:
- **Generate test template:** Write new test cases faster
- **Generate test suite:** Test all possible paths in your code
- **Test-backed diagnostics:** Discover and reproduce runtime exceptions
